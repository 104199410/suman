# SPRINT TENETS

<!-- Xgrid Cloud Cost Control -->

This document describes the rules and structure of a sprint at X-CCC

## Github

Github has a very evolved ecosystem and will be the central place for tracking sprints, feature requests, bugs, user stories and sprint boards.

## Sprint Cadence

Weekly sprints will run from Monday to Monday.

### Sprint Demos & Retro

- Demo the work done in the sprint
- Sprint retro: What worked great?, What can be improved?

### Sprint Planning

- Take items from backlog, and pull in to sprint
- Move over any left over items from last sprint
- Justify why the items were moved from last sprint to current sprint, did we underestimate the complexity? Any other reasons?

### Backlog Grooming

- Groom the project
- What more user stories are needed for the project completion?
- Any technical debt?
- All user stories, that are needed to achieve functional completion of the project, must be added to backlog iteratively(if unclear and evolving)

### GitHub Ticket Management:

---

- We'll be using labels for organizing the tickets
- Primarily Epic label will be used for the user-stories related to one project i.e. epic_data_visualization
- Time estimation for a sprint should be 5 days
- When extending an issue to the next week, you're required to add another label as `moved-from-<sprint-name>`
- Description of each ticket should be according to the template provided in [GitHub Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/X-CBG/projects/65)
