# Terraform AWS IAM Configuration:

This Terraform configuration manages AWS IAM resources, including roles, policies, and users. The configuration is split into several files, as described below.

# Folders

**Pre_requirement**

This folder contains the prerequisite files required to run the Terraform configuration. These files include:

*iam.tf*: This file defines the IAM role resource using the aws_iam_role Terraform resource type. The IAM role allows entities to assume the role and perform actions defined in the attached policies. The file also defines the inline IAM policies that are attached to the role.
*provider.tf:* This file declares the provider plugin to use for this Terraform configuration and sets the AWS region to use.
*variables.tf:* This file declares the input variables for this Terraform configuration. The variables include the AWS region, namespace, owner email, creator email, project name, and IAM permission policies.
*terraform.auto.tfvars:* This file contains the values for the input variables declared in variables.tf. The values are automatically populated by Terraform when you run terraform apply. Do not edit this file directly.

**Policies**

*Permission set JSON files*: The permission set JSON files define the permissions for various AWS resources and services. These files are stored in policies folder and are referenced in iam.tf using the file() function. The JSON files should follow the AWS IAM policy syntax.

# Usage:

    1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the Terraform configuration files.
    2. Run terraform init to initialize the configuration and download the required provider plugins.
    3. Edit the terraform.auto.tfvars file to set the values for the input variables.
    4. Run terraform plan to preview the changes that Terraform will make to the AWS environment.
    5. If the plan looks correct, run terraform apply to apply the changes to the AWS environment.
    6. Verify the changes in the AWS console.

# Notes:

    1. This configuration requires Terraform version 1.0 or later and the AWS provider plugin version 4.0 or later.
    2. Make sure to follow AWS IAM best practices and limit permissions to the minimum required for your use case.
    3. Be careful when applying Terraform changes, as they can have unintended consequences and cause downtime or data loss. Always preview the changes before applying them to the AWS environment.
